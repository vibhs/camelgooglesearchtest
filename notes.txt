To use the Google custom search API, you need an API ID and a search
engine reference. To get either of these you must log into the Google
developer's console (https://console.developers.google.com) and create
a new project. Enable the project for "custom search API", and then
create a new search engine. By "search engine", google means the 
specification of the sites to search and some other settings.
To create a new search engine, see https://www.google.com/cse/. The 
final result of this process will be an API key -- a long sequence
of characters you can add to the search URL using the 'key=' parameter,
and a search engine reference -- a long sequence of characters you can
add to the search URI hsing the 'cx=' parameter. With these settings in
place, a custom search URI looks like this:

https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?q=text+to+search&key={my_api_key}&cx={my_search_engine_ref}

camelgooglesearch.props looks like this:

key={a long string}
cx={another long string}
